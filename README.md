# A Beginner's Example to Angular Animations

This project is meant to be a supplemental set of examples to 
[my blog article covering some of the basic concepts of Angular animations](https://davidboothe.com/2024/11https://davidboothe.com/2024/11/unlocking-the-power-of-angular-animations-a-beginners-guide/). 

The main examples can be found in `/src/app/example-components/`

`triggers`, `states`, `transitions`, and `animations` are covered in the `dropdown` component.

More advanced concepts like `query`, `stagger`, and `group` are covered in the `dropdown-advanced` component.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
